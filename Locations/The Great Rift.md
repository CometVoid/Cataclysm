# Intro

Slowly, steadily, the gales of the great storm die down, the thunder fades, and the temperature drops to more liveable levels. The greast wall has been passed, the prison of the ark escaped, and as the fog starts to clear, what lies before you... is nothing like the texts described

Despite cataclysm, despite the lack of gods, despite the lands covered in scars and craters that tear great gashes across the surface, almost out of spite against the dead gods themselves,  The Rift was green. Not just green, but Lush. Filled with colorful creatures of all shapes and sizes, monsters and animals alike. In the hundreds of years since the cataclysm ended, life had regrown, and the world had gone on.


Birds of countless types flicked through the skies, and ginormous trees reached up and brushed against the underside of the Frontier Nomad. 


Looking into the distance, it seemed to just never end. before, vision had always been limited by the storm wall, but now it was like that if your eyes were good enough, and the day clear enough, you'd truly be able to see forever.


(if they dont try to be stealthy)
Unfortunately, this also means others can see you.

to the port side of the ship, a series of three [[Signal Flares]] rocket into the skies; one yellow, one green, one red.
