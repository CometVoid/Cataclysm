# Description

The great storm wall, with all it's violent glory, spreads out before you. Its churning gales and mountains of angry cloud are occasionally illuminated with bright flashes, quickly followed by chest shaking thunder.

With how viciously the surrounding steamclouds are dragged in and whipped into the abyss, it's difficult to forget the fun fact that everyone gets taught as a kid: that each one of those clouds is the size of a mountain.


This thing was not meant to be passed. It was not designed to be overcome. It is a solid sheet of death, desperate to drag anything foolish enough to try pass into the depths of entropy. It is the end of the world, the border to this reality, keeping the wrath of the cataclysmic wastes from infecting the blessed lands.

It is the magnum opus of a god of war. It is an insurmountable storm. It is a barrier of the most primal powers to keep the demons out, and the blessed ones in...

But on a ship like this, in days like these, your perception is different, isn't it? You all know what this creation truly is. Despite it's original intentions, you know what it is now.
***it is a cage.***



# Summary

The storm wall is the edge of the combined plane called [[The Ark]], and the domain of [[Kohryu the Storm Dragon]]
