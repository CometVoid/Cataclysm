I've rebalanced and simplified crafting from the overpowered hellscape that was crafting in star wars. So here's how to craft in Cataclysm! Crafting something in cataclysm is now far simpler!

# How to craft anything in 3 easy steps

- **Step 1:** Think of what you want to craft (it doesn't need to exist already)
- **Step 2:** Ask for the difficulty
- **Step 3:** Roll the check!

Yes, it's really that simple! Tables are hard to make, and hard to balance, whilst this is much easier, for everyone, and fits in with how everything else in genesys is done.

For reference, something equivalent to most of the weapons listed as items would be an **Average**(difficulty 2) check to craft. Some items that are particularly strong, like the clockwork auto-cannon, would be **Hard**(difficulty 3) to craft, and large projects like an airship might even be **Formiddable**(difficulty 4) or **Impossible**(Difficulty 5, needs a story point to even attempt, Although some particularly simple things, such as a mace or knife, may be **Easy**(1) or even **Simple**(0)

Crafting item attachments also work the same way.

If crafting something would be too difficult, you can try adding negative modifiers like cumbersome, unwieldy, or inaccurate.
# But what about advantages and triumphs?

Advantages can be spent to increase qualities and stats that are already on the weapon even further, to reduce the resource or time cost of crafting, or add qualities such as superior, accurate, or reinforced.

However advantages are spent though, they can only be spent on things that could reasonably be discovered, or 'happy accidents' during creation. You could make a weapon be more durable or cheaper than you originally set out for it to be, but you couldn't end up making a rocket launcher instead of a sniper rifle


For example, let's say you are trying to create a steam powered clockwork assault rifle, with the profile of

| Skill  | Dam | Crit | Range | Encum | Price | Rarity | Special    |
| ------ | --- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ---------- |
| Ranged | 7   | 3    | Medium  | 4     | 500   | 5      | Accurate 1, autofire |

And you rolled 4 advantages and a triumph.

You could use the triumph to add the **superior** quality (making checks with the weapon roll a guaranteed advantage), then spend the spend the advantages to reduce the encumbrance of the weapon to 2, maybe flavouring it as discovering how to use the gas from the gunpowder to cycle the weapon instead of just steam?

# You forgot threats and despairs!

Nuh uh! If you roll threats and despairs, then I as the gm pick negative modifiers for your weapons. Maybe it's heavier or more expensive than expected, maybe the armor has a weakpoint that can make it fall apart if hit, or maybe with a despair, it could simply be **Inferior** (gaurenteed threat on checks)
