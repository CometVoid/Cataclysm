I've rebalanced and simplified crafting from the overpowered hellscape that was crafting in star wars. So here's how to craft in Cataclysm! Crafting something in cataclysm is now far simpler!

# How to craft anything in 3 easy steps

- **Step 1:** Think of what you want to craft
- **Step 2:** Ask for the difficulty
- **Step 3:** Roll the check!

Yes, it's really that simple! Tables are hard to make, and hard to balance, whilst this is much easier, for everyone, and fits in with how everything else in genesys is done.

Most items that can be bought will be at or below an **Average**(difficulty 2) check to craft. Some items that are particularly strong, like the clockwork autocannon, would be **Hard**(difficulty 3) to craft, and large projects like an airship might even be **Formiddable**(difficulty 4) or **Impossible**(Difficulty 5, needs a story point to even attempt)

Items can also be upgraded or modified in the same way.
