Item attachments allow you to customise gear by adding 'attachments' to them. 

Of course, when modifying an item, there are only so many improvements you can add. **Hard Points** (HP) determine how many attachments and other modifications an item can reasonably hold, as each attachment will use a certain number of hardpoints

Most items will have a hardpoint value equal to half it's encumbrance rounded up.
