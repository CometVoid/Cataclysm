A spellblade is a special type of [[Wand]] that is specialized in close combat, and is designed like a sword hilt. 

This wand increases the damage of your magic attacks by +3, and allows you to add the [[Attack Spell|Close Combat]] Additional effect without increasing the difficulty of the spell.

In addition, If you target a creature at engaged range with an attack spell, casting the spell does not require strain.
