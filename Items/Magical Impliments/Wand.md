A Wand is a simple magical implement that allows a caster to add 1 specific **Easy**(1) additional spell effect to any applicable spell without increasing the spell's difficulty. 
For example, a wand of fire might allow you to add the **Burn** quality to your attack spells without increasing the difficulty, or a wand of haste could allow you to add the haste quality to your augment spells.

Additionally, casting an [[Attack Spell]] through a wand increases the damage it does by 3
