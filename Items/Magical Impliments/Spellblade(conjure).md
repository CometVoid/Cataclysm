A spellblade is a special type of [[Wand]] that is specialised in close combat, and is designed like a sword hilt.

When the user casts a spell, adding the close combat effect does not increase its difficulty, and spell attacks add +3 to their damage.

In addition, if you use the conjure spell to conjure a melee weapon, the Weapon remains summoned until the end of the encounter without your character having to use the concentrate maneuver. This only applies to 1 weapon at a time
