A spellblade is a special type of [[Wand]] that is specialised in close combat, and is designed like a sword hilt.

When the user casts a spell, adding the close combat effect does not increase its difficulty, and spell attacks add +3 to their damage.

Additionally, if you summon a melee weapon with conjure, maintaining concentration on the spell requires an incidental instead of a maneuver. This can only apply to one casting of conjure at a time
