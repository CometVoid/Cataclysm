A magic ring is a powerful and very rare magical impliment that usually allow a caster to add multiple additional effects to a spell, whilst only increasing the difficulty of the spell by one. An example could be a ring of protection, that allows the user to add the **Additional Target**, **Range**, and **Empowered** additional effects to a [[Barrier Spell]]. 

Additionally, Casting an [[Attack Spell]] through a magic ring increases the damage it does by 2
