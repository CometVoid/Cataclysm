# Effect

Using a healing potion requires one maneuver for your character to apply it either to themself or to another engaged character. The healing potion is consumed in the process, and the character immediately heals 5 wounds. While a character can use multiple healing potions, this provides diminishing returns. Each potion after the first heals one wound fewer. A second potion heals 4 wounds, a third heals 3, and so on. Using a sixth healing potion in a day has no further effect. 

After one day, the lingering effects of the healing potiions wear off, and the character may use healing potions again with their normal effect (this means a character can consume up to five healing potions a day, each day).
