A generic item profile for a box of stuff required to perform a skill

this could be a toolbox for artificers, an alchemy kit for alchemists, a medkit, a box of incidious tools for breaking into buildings, or maybe even a pack of tools for investigating a crime scene.

On purchase, choose a general skill. The equipment kit counts as the tools required for using that skill, or adds a boost die if tools aren't needed, but would help.
