A spellblade is a special type of wand that is designed like a sword that produces a blade of magic. 

This wand increases the damage of your magic attacks by +3, and allows you to add the [[Attack Spell|Close Combat]] Additional effect without increasing the difficulty of the spell.

A spellblade counts as a melee(light) or melee(heavy) weapon (chosen when bought), and spells cast at engaged ranged with it count as attacking with the spellblade, and as melee(light) combat checks
