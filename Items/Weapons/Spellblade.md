A spellblade is a special type of [[Wand]] that is specialized in close combat, and is designed like a sword hilt. 

This wand increases the damage of your magic attacks by +3, and allows you to add the [[Attack Spell|Close Combat]] Additional effect without increasing the difficulty of the spell.

Attack spells made at engaged range using the spell blade turn into melee weapons with the same qualities as the spell, and use the same characteristic and skill that the spell did.
