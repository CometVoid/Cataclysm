##### effect
Once per session your character may make
an **Average (◆◆)** Knowledge (Arcane) check
during a Network encounter. If you succeed,
your character knows the names, strengths,
and other qualities of all wards (active or
deactivated) on one system that you
currently have access to, as well as all other
characters that currently are accessing that system.
Your character may spend 3 **Advantages** from
this check (whether or not they succeeded)
to add **Successes** to all Wizardry checks involving
that system that they make for the
remainder of the encounter.
