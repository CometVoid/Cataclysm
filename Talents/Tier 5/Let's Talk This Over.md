##### effect
Once per game session, when a combat
encounter against one or more sentient
beings is about to begin, the character make
a **Daunting (◆◆◆◆)** Charm check. If
successful, the combat encounter instead
becomes a social encounter, with the PCs
attempting to convince their opposition to
back down, come around to their viewpoint,
or accept a compromise. The GM is the final
arbiter of how the situation resolves without
violence (or how the combat encounter
continues if the character’s check is
unsuccessful).
