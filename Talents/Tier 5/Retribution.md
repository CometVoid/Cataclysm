Once per round when an adversary attacks
an ally within medium range, your character
may spend one Story Point to use this talent
to automatically hit that enemy once with a
weapon your character is wielding, if the
enemy is within the weapon’s range. The hit
deals the weapon’s base damage, plus any
damage from applicable talents or abilities.
