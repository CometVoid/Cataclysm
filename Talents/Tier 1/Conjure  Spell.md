##### effect
This action represents the ability of a spellcaster to animate objects or create items (or even allies). The character makes a magic skill check. The default difficulty for the check is **Easy (1)**. If the check is successful, the character summons a simple tool with no moving parts (such as a shovel or pickax), a one-handed melee weapon with no moving parts (such as a sword or knife), or a minion no bigger than **silhouette 1** (such as an animal, magical creature, elemental spirit, or even undead monstrosity). These appear engaged with the character. The summoned minion or item remains present until the end of the characterâ€™s next turn. If the character summons a creature, the creature behaves in the best approximation of its natural instincts (as determined by the GM). It is not controlled by the character, and may even be hostile to them. In a structured encounter, it takes its turn immediately after the character.
