The character can use a suitable magic skill (such as water) to make a **Heal Check**. When making the check, the character selects one target they are engaged with who is not incapacitated. The default difficulty of the check is **Easy (1 difficulty)**. Upon success, the character heals 1 wound per uncancelled **Success**, and 1 strain per uncancelled **Advantage**. 

The advantage of a heal spell over a medical check, is that healing magic is not limited to once per encounter
