You gain the **Attack** spell, and can use it with any magic skill.
When making a magic attack, the character must select one target at short range (but not engaged). The default difficulty of the check is **Easy (1 Difficulty)**. The attack deals dam- age equal to the characteristic linked to the skill used to make the attack, plus 1 damage per uncanceled **Success**. The attack has no set Critical rating, so you may only inflict a Critical Injury with a **Triumph**
