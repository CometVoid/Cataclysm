##### effect
Attack spells include any combat check or other action that directly or indirectly deals damage or strain to an enemy. Examples include throwing a fireball, shooting lightning, smiting a foe with magical force, or knocking a foe around the battlefield with invisible blows

When making a magic attack, the character must select one target at short range (but not engaged). The default difficulty of the check is **Easy (1 Difficulty)**. The attack deals dam- age equal to the characteristic linked to the skill used to make the attack, plus 1 damage per uncanceled **Success**. The attack has no set Critical rating, so you may only inflict a Critical Injury with a **Triumph**

You can also add additional effects to your magic attacks by increasing the difficulty of the spell. Here are some examples
