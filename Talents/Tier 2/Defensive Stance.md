Once per round, your character may suffer a  
number of strain no greater than their ranks  
in Defensive Stance to use this talent. Then,  
until the end of your characterâ€™s next turn,  
upgrade the difficulty of all melee combat  
checks targeting your character a number of  
times equal to the strain suffered.
