You gain the Augment spell, and can cast it with any magic skill.

To cast an augment spell, the character selects one target they are engaged with (which can be themself), then makes a magic skill check. The default difficulty of the check is **Average** (2 difficulty). If the check is succesful, until the end of your character's next turn, he target increases the ability of any skill checks they make by one.(in effect, this means they add one green die to their checks)

You can also add the following additional effects to your augment spells, as long as it fits the magic being used

| **Haste**: Targets effected by the spell can always perform a second maneuver during their turn without spending strain (they may still only perform 2 maneuvers per turn)                                                                                                                         | +1             |     |
| **Range**: Increase the range of the spell by one range band. This may be added multiple times, increasing the range by one range band each time.                                                                                                                                                  | +1             |     |
| **Swift**: Targets affected by the spell ignore the effects of difficult terrain and cannot be immobilized                                                                                                                                                                                         | +1             |     |
| **Additional Target**: The spell effects one additional target within range of the spell. In addition, after casting the spell, you may spend one **Advantage** to affect one additional target within range of the spell (and may trigger this multiple times, spending **Advantages** each time) | +2             |     |

You may also think of something not covered by the provided effects, such as temporarily repairing a weapon so that you can continue to wield it, improve the effectiveness of gear, or even turning people or objects invisible or flight. The difficulty of these will vary depending on what you are trying to do. (Basically, just ask the gm). Giving things flight or turnig them invisible will be at least **Hard** (difficulty), while temporarily repairing a simple weapon might even be **Easy**(difficulty 1) or **Simple**(difficulty 0)
