Barrier magics let the spellcaster protect themselves from adverse conditions of all types. Your character may create a bubble under the ocean so they can travel underwater, a barrier that shields them from flames as they walk through a burning building, or even a barrier that deflects an onrushing avalanche

The character selects one target they are engaged with (which can be themself), then makes a magic skill check. The default difficulty of the check is **Easy** (1). If the check is successful, until the end of the characterâ€™s next turn, reduce the damage of all hits the target suffers by one, and further reduce it by one for every uncancelled **2 Successes** beyond the first.

You can also add additional effects to your barrier spells by increasing the difficulty. Here are some examples

| **Additional Target**: The spell affects one additional target within range of the spell. In addition, after casting the spell, you may spend **1 Advantage** to affect one additional target within range of the spell (and may trigger this multiple times, spending **Advantages** each time) | +1             |
| **Range**: Increase the range of the spell by one range band. This may be added multiple times, increasing the range by one range band each time.                                                                                                                                                | +1             |
| **Empowered**:The barrier reduces damage equal to the number of cancelled **Success** instead of the normal effect.                                                                                                                                                                              | +2             |
| **Add Defence**: Each affected target gains ranged and melee defence equal to your ranks in Knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                           | +2             |
| **Reflection**:  If an opponent makes a magic attack against an affected target and generates **3 Threats** or **a Despair** on the check, after the check is resolved, they suffer a hit dealing damage equal to the total damage of the attack.                                                |                |
| **Sanctuary**: Opponents automatically disengage from affected targets, and may not engage them for the duration of the spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                |
