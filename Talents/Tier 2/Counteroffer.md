##### effect
Once per session, when not in a combat encounter, 
your character may use  
this talent to choose one non-nemesis  
adversary within medium range and make an  
opposed Negotiation versus Discipline check.  
If successful, the target becomes staggered  
until the end of their next turn. At your GMâ€™s  
discretion, you may spend **Triumph** on this check to  
have the adversary become an ally until the  
end of the encounter. However, the duration  
of this may be shortened or extended  
depending on whether your GM feels your  
offer is appealing to the adversary and  
whether your character follows through on  
their offer!.
