Your character must have purchased the
[[Freerunner]] talent to benefit from this talent.
Once per round, when using the Freerunner
talent, your character may suffer 4 strain
instead of 1 strain to move to any location
within medium range instead of within short
range. All other restrictions of Freerunner apply to this movement.
