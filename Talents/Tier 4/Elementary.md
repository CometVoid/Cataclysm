Once per session, your character may use
this talent to make a **Hard (◆◆◆)**
Perception check while present at a crime
scene. If they succeed, they identify all
prominent physical characteristics of one
person who was at the crime scene when the
crime was committed (as long as the crime
was committed in the past 48 hours). This
could include a person's height, weight, body
type, clothing, and if they are human or not.
Your character may identify all the physical
characteristics of one additional person
present at the crime scene per additional **Success**.
