Your character may make a **Hard (◆◆◆)**
Artifice check and spends 12 hours
constructing a secure position that can
contain the group and its vehicles. The sum
of the vehicle's silhouettes must be 4 or less.
The position provides cover and can have
additional narrative benefits at the GM’s
discretion. Your character can spend 2 **Advantages** or
a **Triumph** from the check to increase the ranged
defense the position provides to 2.
