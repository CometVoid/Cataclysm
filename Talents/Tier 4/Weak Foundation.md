Once per game session, your character may
identify one bunker, weapon emplacement,
or other fixed combat structure (subject to
the GM’s approval) and then take a Weak
Foundation action; make a **Hard (◆◆◆)**
Knowledge(Science) check. If successful, until the end
of the encounter, your character and all allies
add automatic 2 **Advantages** or **Successes** to all combat
checks made targeting the structure (your
character's choice).
