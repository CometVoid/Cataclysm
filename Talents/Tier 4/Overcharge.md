Once per encounter, your character may use
this talent to make a **Hard (◆◆◆)**
Artifice check and choose one of their
cybernetic implants that grants them one of
the following: +1 to a characteristic rating, +1
rank to a skill, +1 rank of a ranked talent. If
your character succeeds, until the end of the
encounter, the chosen cybernetic instead
provides +2 to the affected characteristic
rating (to a maximum of 7), skill (to a
maximum of 5), or ranked talent. Your GM
may spend a 3 **Threats** from the check to
have the overcharged cybernetic short out at
the end of the encounter; it provides no
benefit until your character spends several
hours or until making an **Average (◆◆)** Mechanics
check to repair it.
