##### effect
Your character can use this talent to make an
opposed Charm or Deception versus
Discipline check targeting a single non-
nemesis adversary within medium range. If
the check succeeds, the target cannot attack
your character (or perform hostile actions
against your character) until the end of their
next turn. You may spend 2 **Advantages** to increase
the length of the effect by one additional
turn, and spend a **Triumph** to extend the benefits to
all of their identified allies within short range.
The effect ends immediately if your character
or a known ally attacks the target. In
addition, your GM may rule that some
targets are immune to this ability. An
automated sentry turret, for example, has no
interest in resolving a conflict through
talking, nor would someone consumed by
rage and the desire for revenge against your
character.
