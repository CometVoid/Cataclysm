While driving or flying, your character may
use this talent to make a **Hard (◆◆◆)**
Piloting or Driving check. If successful, the
top speed of the vehicle increases by one (to
a maximum of 5) for a number of rounds
equal to your character’s Cunning. The
specifics of this talent require the optional
vehicle rules, on page 220. If your game does
not use these rules, this talent simply makes
the vehicle go much faster than normal, with
the specifics up to your GM.
