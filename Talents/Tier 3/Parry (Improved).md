Your character must have purchased the Parry talent to benefit from this talent. When your character suffers a hit from a melee combat check and uses Parry to reduce the damage from that hit, after the attack is resolved, you may spend 3 **Threats** from the attacker’s check to use this talent. Then, your character automatically hits the attacker once with a Brawl or Melee weapon your character is wielding. The hit deals the weapon’s base damage, plus any damage from applicable talents or abilities. Your character can’t use this talent if the original attack incapacitates them.
