When you purchase this talent for your
character, choose two characteristics. You
may spend a Story Point to use this talent to
have your character ignore the effects of all
Critical Injuries on any skill checks using those
two characteristics until the end of the
current encounter. (Your character still
suffers the Critical Injuries; they just ignore
the effects. See page 114.)
