##### effect
if your character does not make a combat
check during their turn, they use this talent
to target one character (or minion group)
within long range. That character must
upgrade the difficulty of any ranged combat
checks they make once until the end of your
character’s next turn. Your character may
choose to affect one additional character for
each additional rank of Suppressing Fire.
Your character must be holding a ranged
weapon to use this talent.
Your GM can also rule that your character
can’t use this talent if they have no line of
fire or range to the target.
