##### effect
Your character must have taken at least one rank of [[Overchannel]] to benefit from this talent.
In addition to the effects of Overchannel, you may also add (◆◆) effects. The character gains one **Despair** (including the associated failure) per (◆◆) effect added in this way rather than increase the difficultly of the check. This is in addition to any **Despair** rolled.
