##### effect
This action represents the combat use of curse magic. Your character selects one target within short range, then makes an Arcana or Divine skill check. The default difficulty of the check is **Average (2)**. If it is successful, until the end of the character’s next turn, the target decreases the ability of any skill checks they make by one (in effect, this means they remove one green die from their checks)

Effectively, this is the opposite of the [[Augment Spell]]

You may also add addtional effects to your curse spells by increasing the difficulty of the check. Here are some examples
