- **Changeling:** As an incidental, you may suffer 4 strain to start changing your appearance. You can change your appearance to look like anything, as long as you maintain roughly the same skeletal structure, and you maintain the same weight. Changing your appearance takes time. Simple changes like eye color can be as quick as an incidental, whilst major changes like height and gender can take up to a minute. You do not revert to your original form on death, and you may not even remember your 'original' form. 
- **Demonic**: Innate rank of [[Dark Insight]]


# Description

Changeling demons, or Chan'on, are cunning demons that make great spies and infiltrators. The amount of Chan'on that exist in the theocracy are far greater than anyone ever expects...
Because of their shapechanging nature, Chan'on naturally find it hard to trust, and they are often quite solitary.
