# Summary
The Ravanicas were a group of vampire type demons that wormed their way into Helios' domain near the end of the cataclysm, via infecting and posing as a lineage of beautiful albino faun'in. They became a royal family via the blessing of [[Selene]], the goddess of the moons and creator of [[Moonstone]]

They only had 3 generations after marrying in to the royal family, which ended once [[Andrell Ravanica]]'s crimes came to light, and they were discovered to be vampires.

The only surviving member of Ravanica is [[Kirivon Ravanica]], who survived his execution due to a contract he made with the Corpse God out of desperation, and the effects of Andrell's experimentation.
