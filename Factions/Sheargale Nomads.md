The sheargale nomads are an alliance of airships in [[The Great Rift]] that surrounds [[The Storm Wall]]. While they lack any physical headquarters or flagship, they are still a highly organised faction of oddballs and rejects from other factions, whether it be adventurers wanting to explore the ruins, or criminals hiding from authorities.
