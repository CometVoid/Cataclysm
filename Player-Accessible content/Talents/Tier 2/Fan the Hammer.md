##### effect
Once per encounter before making a combat  
check with a pistol (your GM has the final say  
on whether a weapon is a pistol or not), your  
character may use this talent to add the  
Auto-fire quality to the pistol when resolving  
the check. If your character does, the  
weapon runs out of ammo exactly as with an  
Out of Ammo result (see page 104).
