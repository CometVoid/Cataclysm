Activation: Maneuver
Ranked: No
##### effect
You may spend a Story Point to use this
talent to have your character temporarily
repair one damaged item they are engaged
with. For a number of rounds equal to your
character's ranks in Mechanics, the item may
be used without penalty (see page 89 of the
GENESYS Core Rulebook), even if it is
unusable. When the effect ends, the item is
damaged one additional step; if it was
already suffering from major damage, it is
destroyed and cannot be repaired.
