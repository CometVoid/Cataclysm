##### effect
Once per round, your character may suffer 1
strain to use this talent and move to any
location within short range.
This includes locations that are vertically
distant or have no easy access route, but
there must be an object to move across or
path to move along. Your GM may rule some
locations cannot be reached (such as ones
behind locked doors or walls).
