##### effect
Your character creates a bond with a single
animal approved by your GM. This animal
must be silhouette 0 (no larger than a mid-
sized dog). The bond persists as long as your
character chooses, although at your GM’s
discretion, the bond may also be broken due
to abusive treatment or other extenuating
circumstances. As long as the bond persists,
the animal follows your character, and you
dictate the animal’s overall behavior
(although, since the animal is only bonded
with the character, not dominated, it may
still perform inconvenient actions such as
scratching furniture, consuming rations, and
marking territory). Once per round in
structured encounters, your character may
spend one maneuver to direct their animal in
performing one action and one maneuver
during your character’s turn. The animal
must be within hearing and visual range of
your character (generally medium range) to
do this. Otherwise, the animal does not
contribute to the encounter. The specifics of
its behavior are up to you and your GM. For
every additional rank of Animal Companion
your character has, increase the allowed
silhouette of the companion by one (this may
mean your character gets a new companion,
or their companion grows in size). This talent
can also change in flavor depending on the
nature of your game setting. While an animal
companion may make sense in many
settings, in a futuristic setting it may make
more sense for the “animal” to be a robot or
drone, for example.
