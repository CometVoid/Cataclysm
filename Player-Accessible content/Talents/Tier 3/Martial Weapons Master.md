##### effect
While armed with a Melee weapon, your
character may use this talent to make an
**Average (◆◆)** Melee check. If successful,
your character may force one engaged target
to either drop one weapon they are holding
or move up to one range band in a direction
of your choosing.
If your character forces a named rival or
nemesis into dangerous terrain (or off a
ledge or cliff) using this talent, your GM can
spend a Story Point to allow them to catch
themselves at the edge and fall prone
instead.
