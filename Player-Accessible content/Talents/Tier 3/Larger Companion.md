Your character must have purchased the [[Companion]] talent to benefit from this talent. Your [[Companion]] can now be 1 silhouette larger per rank of [[Larger Companion]]. Additionally, if you have [[Companion (Improved)]], the wound and strain threshold provided by [[Toughened]] and [[Grit]], and soak given by [[Enduring]], may instead be equal to your companion's silhouette.
