Your character may use this talent to make
an opposed Brawl versus Resilience check
targeting one engaged opponent. If the check
succeeds, the target is knocked prone and is
immobilized until the end of your characterâ€™s
next turn. If the target is a minion or rival,
your character can spend a **Triumph** to incapacitate
(but not kill) the target instead.
