Your character may use this talent to attack
an unaware adversary using a Melee (Light)
weapon. A Backstab is a melee attack, and
follows the normal rules for performing a
combat check (see page 101 of the Genesys
Core Rulebook), using the characterâ€™s
Skullduggery skill instead of Melee (Light). If
the check succeeds, each uncanceled **Successa** adds
+2 damage (instead of the normal +1)
