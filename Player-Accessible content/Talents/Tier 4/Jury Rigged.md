##### effect
The character chooses one personal weapon
or piece of armor per rank of Jury Rigged. They
may increase the damage of the weapon by
one; decrease the a cost on its Critical, or
any single other effect by one to a minimum
of one; or increase armor's ranged or melee
defense by one. Alternatively, they can
decrease the encumbrance of the item by
two to a minimum of one. The bonus only
applies so long as the character is using the
item. If the item is ever lost or destroyed, the
character may apply Jury Rigged to a new
personal weapon or piece or armor.
