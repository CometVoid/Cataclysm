##### effect
While engaged in a debate or argument,
make a **Hard (◆◆◆)** Negotiation check. If
successful, a number of bystanders or
observers equal to your Presence sees one of
the opponent’s points (chosen by your
character) as maliciously unreasonable.

The GM has the final say as to whether
bystanders could see a point as
unreasonable, based on who those
bystanders are and what the point is. In these
cases, the GM can suggest a modified version
of that argument that would be more
believable
