##### effect
Once per round on the character’s turn,
when the character performs an Aim
maneuver before attempting a combat
check, may suffer a number of strain. The
number of strain cannot exceed his ranks in
Precise Aim. They then decrease the target’s
defense (ranged and melee) by one per strain
suffered for that combat check.
