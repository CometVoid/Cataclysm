Once per session, your character may use
this talent to make a Artifice check to
attempt to cobble together the functional
equivalent of any item using spare parts or
salvage. The difficulty of the check is based
on the item’s rarity; see Table I.4–1: Mad
Inventor Item Rarity in the Genesys Core
Rulebook. Your GM will modify the check
based on the circumstances and might decide
that some items simply can’t be created with
what’s available (if you are being held in a
prison cell, for instance). Your GM may spend
a **despair** on the check to indicate the item ends up
being dangerous to the user and anyone
around them in some way. For instance, a
pistol might explode instead of running out
of ammo, or a breathing mask might make
the user light-headed.
