##### effect
Once per session, after capturing or stealing
data about an opponent, your character may
make an **average (◆◆)** Knowledge check to
determine its value. If successful, once before
the end of the session your character may
add automatic **Successes** equal to their ranks in
Knowledge to one check related to the
captured data. The GM has the final say on
what checks are related to the data.
