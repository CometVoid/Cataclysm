Your character must have purchased the
[[Field Commander]] talent to benefit from this
talent. When your character uses the Field
Commander talent, your character affects a
number of allies equal to twice the
characterâ€™s Presence. In addition, you may
spend 1 **Triumph** to allow one ally to suffer 1 strain
to perform an action, instead of a maneuver.
