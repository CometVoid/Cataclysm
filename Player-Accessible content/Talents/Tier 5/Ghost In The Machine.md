As long as they have some sort of access
point to the Network, your character may use
this talent to make a **Hard (◆◆◆)**
Computers (Hacking) check. If they succeed,
they may select one drone, vehicle, or piece
of equipment involved in the current
encounter and dictate its actions until the
start of your character’s next turn.
Alternatively, your character can select
someone with cybernetic implants or who is
wearing powered armor or an exosuit and
manipulate it until the beginning of your
character’s next turn. This must be approved
by your GM but could include shutting off
cybereyes, directing the movements of
cyberlimbs, or causing an exosuit to eject its
occupant.
Your character may spend aaa on the
check to extend the effects for one additional
round, or they may spend t to extend the
effects for the remainder of the encounter
