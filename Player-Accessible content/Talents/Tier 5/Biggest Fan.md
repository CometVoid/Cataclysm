##### effect
Once per session, may take a Biggest Fan
action; make a **Hard (◆◆◆)** Charm check to
turn one NPC into the character's biggest fan.
The exact effects of this vary depending on
the NPC and the situation. They can include
drastically decreasing the difficulty of Social
Interaction skill checks the character makes
targeting his biggest fan, the fan being willing
to perform minor or even significant favors
for the character, or the character even
becoming a reoccurring ally in the narrative.
At the CM’s discretion, this talent may not be
able to target certain NPCs whose adversarial
nature is vital to the plot, or NPCs who would
be unable to appreciate the character’s work
