##### effect
When resolving an attack from a personal
scale explosive or ordinance weapon, your
character may spend 1 **Advantage** to have the
weaponâ€™s Blast quality affect all characters
within short range (rather than engaged). If
the weapon normally affects all characters
within short range, then the range of the
effect is increased to medium range instead.
