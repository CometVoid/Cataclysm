##### effect
Once per encounter, when your character
would be incapacitated due to exceeding
their wound or strain threshold, you may
spend a Story Point to use this talent. Then,
your character is not incapacitated until the
end of their next turn. If your character
reduces their strain or wounds to below their
threshold before the end of their next turn,
they are not incapacitated.
