Once per session, your character may use
this talent to make a **Hard (◆◆◆)** Discipline
check. If they succeed, they reveal that
whatever terrible circumstances they
currently find themselves in are all part of a
brilliant plan that they established at an
earlier point. They then choose one non-
nemesis adversary in the encounter and
reveal them to be a close friend or ally who
has positioned themselves to help your
character at this exact moment.
The details of which character turns out to be
an ally depend on the type of encounter and
your GM’s approval. However, the ally could
also have done their work before-hand, such
as loading a squadron of drones with blank
ammunition, shutting down power to a
security system, or planting a tracer in an
opponent’s vehicle.
