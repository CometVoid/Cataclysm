##### effect
Once per encounter, your character may use
this talent to make an opposed Charm or
Coercion versus Discipline check targeting
one character within medium range (or
within earshot). If successful, the target
suffers strain equal to twice your character’s
Presence, plus one additional strain per **Success**.
Your character heals strain equal to the strain
inflicted. If incapacitated due to this talent,
the target could flee the scene in shame,
collapse in a dejected heap, or throw
themself at your character in fury, depending
on your GM and the nature of your
character’s witty barbs.
