##### effect
When your character selects this talent they choose one want, staff, ring, or other such focus that they own. The amount of wards or hexes (your character's choice) that they can have on that object is increased by 1 per rank of Custom Focus. (This may be a mix of wards and hexes, as long as the combined total increase does not exceed your character's ranks in Custom Focus). If your character loses their affected focus, they may choose a new focus to be affected by this talent.
