##### effect
Once per round during your character's turn, your character can use this talent to mount or dismount from a vehicle or animal, or move from one position in a vehicle to another (such as from the cockpit to a gun turret) as an incidental. In addition, if your character suffers a short-range fall (see page 112) from a vehicle or animal, they suffer no damage and land on their feet.
