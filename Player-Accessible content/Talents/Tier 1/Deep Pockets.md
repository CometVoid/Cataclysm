Once per session, your character may use this talent to produce a small but narratively useful item from their pockets, backpack, or similar receptacle (it turns out the item had been there the whole time). Your GM has final say as to what items can be produced with Deep Pockets, but generally the item should cost less than 100 currency and have an encumbrance of 0 or 1.
