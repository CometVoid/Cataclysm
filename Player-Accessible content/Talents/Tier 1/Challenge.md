Once per encounter, your character may use this talent to choose a number of adversaries within short range no greater than your characterâ€™s ranks in Challenge! (a minion group counts as a single adversary for this purpose). Until the encounter ends or your character is incapacitated, these adversaries add ***one boost die*** to combat checks targeting your character and ***two setback die*** to combat checks targeting other characters.
