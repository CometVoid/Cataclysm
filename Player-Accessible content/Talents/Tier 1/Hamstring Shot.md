##### effect
Once per round, your character may use this talent to perform a ranged combat check against one non-vehicle target within range of the weapon used. If the check is successful, halve the damage inflicted by the attack (before reducing damage by the targetâ€™s soak). The target is immobilized until the end of its next turn.
