When your character suffers a hit from a Ranged combat check, after damage is calculated but before soak is applied, your character may suffer 3 strain to use this talent to reduce the damage of the hit by two plus their ranks in [[Parry]]. This talent can only be used once per hit, and your character needs to be wielding a Shield or Melee weapon deemed appropriate by the GM.
