When your character selects this talent they choose a number of wards or hexes that they own, up to their ranks of Custom spells. If they choose a hex, whenever they use that focus to break wards, they add an **advantage** to the results. If they choose a ward, whenever someone else attempts to break it, they add a **threat** to the results.
